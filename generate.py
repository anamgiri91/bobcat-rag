"""
generate.py
===========
Generation layer for the Bobcat RAG pipeline.

Takes retrieved chunks and a user query, builds a grounded prompt,
calls the Groq API, and returns the answer + programmatically
extracted source list.

KEY DESIGN DECISIONS
--------------------
1. Grounding is enforced in the system prompt — the LLM is explicitly
   told it may ONLY use the provided context and must refuse to answer
   if the context is insufficient.

2. Source attribution is PROGRAMMATIC — sources are extracted from
   chunk metadata BEFORE the LLM is called, not extracted from the
   LLM output. This guarantees sources are always shown and always
   accurate, regardless of whether the model mentions them.

3. The LLM never sees the source list we build — it only sees the
   context text. This prevents the model from fabricating or
   reordering sources.

4. For comparison queries ("best professor for X"), the context is
   grouped by professor so the LLM sees all reviews for each professor
   together, rather than interleaved chunks that make comparison hard.

FIXES APPLIED
-------------
Fix 1: Removed duplicate COMPARISON_SIGNALS list and _is_comparison_query()
       function. Both now live exclusively in retrieve.py — generate.py
       imports them from there. Previously the two lists were out of sync
       (generate.py had "difference between professors"; retrieve.py had
       "difference between" + "should i take"), causing routing mismatches.

Fix 2: _build_grouped_context() source_label now checks ALL chunks for a
       professor, not just the first. If a professor has chunks from both
       rmp and coursicle, the label correctly reads "RateMyProfessors +
       Coursicle" instead of whichever source happened to appear first.

Setup:
    pip install groq python-dotenv
    Add GROQ_API_KEY=your_key to your .env file

STRICT GROUNDING RULES:
1. Answer ONLY using information from the CONTEXT provided. Never use prior knowledge.
2. If context lacks enough information, say exactly:
   "I couldn't find enough information in the retrieved sources to answer that question."
3. Never invent, guess, or assume professor traits, grading policies, or difficulty.
4. If reviews conflict (one says easy, another hard), acknowledge both views.
5. Do not use phrases like "generally" or "typically" — cite specific review content.

RESPONSE QUALITY RULES:
6. For "best professor" or comparison questions:
   - Summarise what reviewers say about EACH professor separately
   - Cover: teaching style, exam difficulty, workload, grading, office hours
   - Note the number of reviews you are drawing from
   - Give a concrete recommendation at the end based ONLY on the review patterns
   - Do NOT just say "reviews are mixed" — that is unhelpful. Synthesise the pattern.
7. Keep answers focused and specific. Name professors directly.
8. Use a friendly, direct tone suited for a student making a course decision."""
