=================
Run this before moving to Milestone 5 to verify retrieval quality.

This version prints results to the terminal AND saves the full output
to a text file.

Usage:
    python3 test_retrieval.py
    python3 test_retrieval.py --db data/chroma_db
    python3 test_retrieval.py --db data/chroma_db --out retrieval_report.txt

If your file is named test_retreival.py, run:
    python3 test_retreival.py --db data/chroma_db --out retrieval_report.txt
